#JSHint TextMate Bundle

**JSHint.tmbundle is a simple modification of the excellent [jslint.tmbundle](https://github.com/fgnass/jslint.tmbundle) by [Felix Gnass](https://github.com/fgnass), in order to support [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) instead of [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/).**

Features:

* Pretty UI
* Runs automatically upon save (⌘S)
* Can be bypassed by pressing ⇧⌘S
* Output is only shown when errors are found
* Window is automatically closed when it looses focus
* Based on Node.js
* Uses an unmodified version (2011-02-19) of [jshint.js](http://jshint.com/jshint.js)
* No Ruby, no Perl, no RegExps needed
